#### User Workflow:
1. **Build progression** → MeasureGrid.js with pill-based beat slots
2. **Select direction** → Choose movement pattern from VLDirectionalControls
3. **Calculate voicings** → System finds chords based on directional preference
4. **Lock preferred results** → Preserve good voicings with lock icons
5. **Fine-tune settings** → Adjust fret range, jump size, favorites usage
6. **Save/export** → VL file format or PDF tablature export

## ⭐ Multi-Customization Favorite System - PRODUCTION READY

#### User Interface Pattern:
```
Normal State: ⭐ 🎛️(2) ⚙️
- ⭐ = Toggle favorite status  
- 🎛️(2) = Cycle through 2 saved customizations + default (0)
- ⚙️ = Open management panel for CRUD operations
```

## 🎨 Button Hierarchy System - PRODUCTION READY

### Master Controller Architecture

Established color note buttons as exclusive master controllers across all modes, ensuring consistent interaction patterns.

#### Color Button System:
- **Green Buttons**: Played chord tones (click to mute → grey)
- **Yellow Buttons**: Unison strings (click to mute → grey)  
- **Grey Buttons**: Muted notes (click to restore → original green/yellow)
- **Red Buttons**: Immutable unavailable notes (never changeable)
- **Light Blue Background**: Visual indicator for favorited chord voicings

#### Correct Architecture Pattern:
```
CHORD CALCULATION (Pure) → COLOR NOTE BUTTONS (Master Filter) → DISPLAY
                           ↑                    ↑
                           TG Buttons          String Masking UI  
                           (individual toggle) (batch control + visual hide)
```

#### Cross-Mode Consistency:
- **CF/CD modes**: Direct color button interaction
- **VL mode**: Same color button behavior with tablature integration
- **TG buttons**: Work through color button system (never bypass)
- **String masking**: UI-only control, preserves underlying chord data

## 🎵 Radial Chord Menu System - PRODUCTION READY

### Context-Aware Enharmonic Implementation

Advanced circular chord selection with "Key is King" implementation and professional enharmonic spelling.

- **RadialWheelChordRoots.js** - Pre-calculated context-aware chord arrays
- **ExtendedChordMenu.js** - Extended chord type selection system
- **Key transposition integration** - Unified enharmonic consistency

#### Key Features:
✅ **"Key is King"**: F major and D minor use identical wheel states  
✅ **Context-Aware Spelling**: F major IV = B♭ (not A♯), based on key context  
✅ **Circle Offset System**: Outer(Major), Middle(Minor), Inner(Diminished) with fixed positioning  
✅ **Professional Notation**: Unicode symbols (♭, ♯, 𝄫, 𝄪) matching printed music
